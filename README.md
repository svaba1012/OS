### OS

Simple OS still in development. I started this project as a way to check and improve my existing knowledge. Currently this OS has heap, some interrupt handlers, supports virtual memory (pagging), has simple file system (FAT16), can run one user program... Next I try to build kernel call functionality. I used qemu to test it.
